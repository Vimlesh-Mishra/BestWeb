          One of the world's great cities, Mumbai has been the hub of the
          country's economic and industrial activity. It has other istinctions
          too. The Indian National Congress. which spearheaded the country's
          struggle for freedom, was founded in Mumbai. The city has been justly
          famous for being the most receptive of any in the country to new ideas
          and trends, particularly to those from the West. The forward-looking
          and disciplined ways of its people evoke the admiration of everyone
          from the other parts of the country who is on his first visit to the
          city.

            And yet, about three hundred years ago, Mumbai was no more than an
            obscure bunch of tiny islands. They were not even proper islands.
            Only at high tide they were cut off from one another. Sometime at
            the beginning of the eighteenth century these islands' were joined
            together to form what was to grow into the First City of India. The
            growth, in area and population, as well as in material prosperity,
            has been unabated till this day.

          It was in the period from 1820 to 1857 that Mumbai took its first
          strides towards becoming a 'modern' city. The period witnessed many
          significant changes. The most important of them, probably, was the use
          of steamships for the voyage to England, and the opening of the
          'Overland Route', Mumbai built its first steamer in about 1830. The
          ship was propelled by the paddle wheels on its sides. You went by
          steamer to Suez, then travelled by land to the Mediterranean Sea for
          taking a boat to England. This was the 'Overland Route'. Till then you
          had to take a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope, and it occupied no
          less than five months. Now it was a matter of a mere month and a half.
          With England thus brought closer, the trade between India and England
          began to expand. Mumbai started wearing a new complexion. The entire
          water-front from Colaba to Mazgaon was soon lined by wharfs, docks and
          godowns

      <h1>MUMBAI'S ROADS</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Early nineteenth century Mumbai could not have been proud of its
          roads. Even the so-called main roads were very narrow. Horse-owners
          would often use them forstabling the animals. The government woke up
          to the situation in 1806, and issued orders for the widening of the
          Parel Road and the Breach Candy Road to sixty feet.The Sheikh Memon
          Road and the Dongri Road were widened to forty feet. Twenty feet was
          laid down as the minimum width for the cross-streets. The city, as
          weknow, has not yet done with the widening of its roads.
        </p>

            The city underwent remarkable transformation during the sixties of
            the last century. Wide modern-looking roads wereplanned. By 1868 the
            roads from the Elphinstone Circle to Bazargate, and from there to
            Foras Road, had beencompleted. Apollo Street was widened. Bellasis
            Road, and the road linking Babula Tank with Elphinstone Bridge,
            werelaid during these years.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The population of certain parts of the city, like Dongri, Mazgaon,
          Girgaon, Byculla and Mahalaxmi, was increasing which necessiated new
          roads and the widening ofthe existing ones; the Girgaon Road, for
          example, was widened; and so were the roads in the Kamathipura area.
          Charni Road was extended to Falkland Road. Worliand Parel were linked
          by a road, named Fergusson Road. The Jacob Circle was laid; so was
          Sankhli Street. All these were macadamised roads. Tarred roads had
          notyet been heard of, The first steam-roller appeared on the City
          roads in 1869
        </p>
        <p>
          The city had its first gas-light in 1833. The credit for it goes to
          Shri Ardeshir Cursetjee, who had installed a plant for producing
          coal-gas at his residence. The Governor of Bombay, we are told, once
          visited Shri Cursetjee's place when it was lighted up with gas lamps.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was in the same year that street lighting was proposed; but it was
          not before the proposal was discussed threadbare for ten years that
          Mumbai's streets had lightsfor the first time (1843). These were
          kerosene lamps. The first gas lamps appeared on Mumbai's roads in
          October 1865. Bhendi Bazar, Esplanade Road (nowMahatma Gandhi Road)
          and Churchgate Street were the roads chosen for the honour. It was
          quite an excitement for the Mumbaite. Crowds of people would follow
          thelamp-lighter; they would watch him do it with almost a sense of
          wonder. The idea of gas-lighting caught on so well that several
          well-to-do citizens donated largeornamental gas-lamps for being put up
          at some important spots in the city.
        </p>

            It was at about this time that some of the fine public buildings
            which give the city its imposing look came up, particularlyin the
            Fort area. The road from Museum to Flora Fountain was lined on
            either side by what were for those days hugebuildings. A dignified
            edifice was put up to house the Secretariat.

          The small University area next to it distinguished itself
          architecturally with the Convocation Hall, and the Rajabai Tower
          over-topping the Library. The solemn gothicpile of the High Court next
          to it held you with its stately dimensions. These structures appeared
          around the year 1870. Soon the stretch between Flora Fountain andthe
          Crawford Market had equally impressive buildings. Mumbai was by then
          an attractive city, not merely a prosperous one.

          The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company (G.I.P ., for short) was
          established in 1849. Its first train, the first in the country, ran
          from Mumbai to Thane on 16th April1853. In 1865, the railway went over
          the Borghat. By 1870 Calcutta and Madras had been linked with Mumbai
          by rail. The Bombay Baroda and Central India Railwaywas started in
          1855. Getting off to a start with the opening of a cotton mill in
          1850, the textile industry soon made phenomenal progress.

            About 1670, the population of Mumbai was around ten thousand. It has
            been growing since then. When a regularcensus was taken in 1864, the
            figure was somewhere near eight lakhs. Now it seems to have crossed
            a crore ! With theopening of the Suez Canal in 1870, England was
            only fifteen days away from Mumbai, by sea. This had much to dowith
            the growth of Mumbai.It gave the Mumbai port an important place on
            the map of the world's sea routes. Mumbaistarted prospering, and it
            has not looked back since.

      <h1>MEANS OF CONVEYANCE</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          At the beginning of the nineteentheyance in the city had been what
          were called the shigram (horse-drawn), the rekla (bullock-drawn) and
          the palkhi (palanquin). Nowthe gharry, a horse-drawn vehicle, joined
          them. A modified version of it, called the 'Victoria', was put on the
          roads in 1882. There were some twenty-five or thirty standsfor
          vehicles in the city - as at Colaba, Apollo bunder, the Municipal
          Offices, the Portuguese Church at Girgaum, and Lalbaug. The fares were
          modest : for a mile'sroad, the horse-drawn vehicle charged one four
          annas (twenty-five paise, to us) and the 'rekla' three annas. Of
          course the wedding season or a dislocation caused byheavy rains was
          then, as now, something of a 'heaven-sent' opportunity for pitching
          their fares higher. Bullock carts carried all the heavier goods. There
          were no hand-carts yet. Tram-cars started plying towards the end of
          the nineteenth century. However, attempts seem to have been made
          earlier to provide some kind of a stage-transport system. An 1819
          issue of the Bombay Courier carried an announcement by a certain firm,
          named 'Architect and Coach-maker'. It said that if the schemereceived
          adequate support the firm would start a horse-coach service from the
          Fort to Sion, stopping at suitable places. The residents of the
          Byculla-Parel area wereparticularly assured that such a service would
          be a great convenience to them.

          The first motor car appeared on Mumbai roads in 1901. Today the city
          has over six lakhs vehicles, which include motor cars, buses, trucks,
          scooters, bicyclesMumbai's roads are well nigh groaning under this
          wheeled traffic, but the very magnitude of the traffic is an index of
          the city's stupendous growth. Another year thatstands out in the
          history of the city is 1872 : the year of the establishment of the
          Municipal Corporation for the city. The citizens were given local
          self-government; therate payers could elect their representatives on
          the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the city growing at such a pace, a well-organised road transport
          system became a necessity. Soon the Bombay Tranway Company Ltd. was
          set up.
